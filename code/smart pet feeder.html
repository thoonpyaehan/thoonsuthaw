   <h2> About us</h2>
   <p style="color: orangered;">My name is Susan Ingyin Phyu and I am in my early teens. I am raised by a high-class family but being stubborn and disrespectful as being spoilt is not my option. I never try to underestimate a person nor their life. Equality is the key of life as I’m being taught from a young age, thanks to my guardians. Throughout my life, technology’s been such a blessing; it has informed me with unimaginable knowledge filled with mind-blowing information. From everyday gadgets (phones and laptops) to extraordinary ones (smart robots), there’s no such things as intriguing as technology. We all can relate how technology is important to our lives. As a matter of fact, it is defined as “Something, all of us cannot live without”.</p>
   <p style="color: orangered;">Unfortunately, not all of us receive this gift from the god. As a consequence of sadly being struck in a poverty (not having enough money to meet basic need including food, clothing and shelter) or illiteracy (lacking in abilities of reading and writing), it is much more tough and puzzling to catch up with today’s modern technologies. In fact, only a few percent of them know well about this particular topic specifically. As a solution, we’ve built a website where everyone is welcomed to learn about latest extraordinary gadgets. Therefore, considering this purpose, there could be less inequality between human society. Thank you very much for your time. </p></aside>

      	An automatic smart pet feeder is an astonishing gadget where a specific pet is being automatically treated their meals at predetermined times whether the owner is engaged with hustling schedules or not.   

        Invented by. Raymond V. Sweeny in 1939, these Automatic feeders help provide proper weight management by giving your pet the portioned feedings they need besides being an assistant robot for feeding your pets. For instance; If you have a pet who gulps his food or eats too fast, a feeder can help him slow down. The Slow Feed option with the new Simply Feed pet feeder dispenses each meal over a 15-minute period.

 	      To operate the AutoDiet SMART feeder simply attach a wireless tag to the collar of each pet. When a pet attempts to feed it will be instantly recognized and registered. Once registered, you can program the feeder so that it welcomes your pet by name and allow or exclude pets as you desire. Automatic pet feeders are meant to dispense a specified amount of food at a designated time so you don't have to. Although they sound like a great solution to caring for your pet while you're away, they're not always reliable, nor are they built with most pets in mind.  </p></aside>
